# Association Rule Learning

This repository houses implementations of two popular Association Rule Mining algorithms: Apriori and Eclat. Association rule mining is a data mining technique used to discover relationships, patterns, and associations within large transactional datasets.

## Apriori Algorithm

The "apriori" folder contains the Apriori algorithm implementation in Python. Apriori is a widely used algorithm for association rule mining. It identifies frequent itemsets and generates association rules based on support, confidence, and lift.

### Code Overview

- **Importing the Libraries:** The code begins by installing the `apyori` library and importing necessary libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.

- **Data Preprocessing:** It reads transactional data from a CSV file, preprocesses it, and extracts transactions for analysis.

- **Training the Apriori Model:** The Apriori model is trained on the dataset using the `apriori` function with specified parameters.

- **Visualizing the Results:** The results, including association rules and their metrics, are displayed and organized in a Pandas DataFrame.

### Usage

Feel free to explore the "apriori" folder to understand and use the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining.

## Eclat Algorithm

The "eclat" folder contains the Eclat algorithm implementation in Python. Eclat is an efficient algorithm for association rule mining that leverages a vertical data format and an intersection-based approach.

### Code Overview

- **Importing the Libraries:** Similar to the Apriori implementation, this code installs the `apyori` library and imports relevant Python libraries.

- **Data Preprocessing:** It loads transactional data from a CSV file, preprocesses it, and prepares the data for analysis.

- **Training the Eclat Model:** The Eclat model is trained on the dataset using the `apriori` function with specified parameters.

- **Visualizing the Results:** The results, including association rules and their metrics, are displayed and organized for analysis.

### Usage

Explore the "eclat" folder to understand and utilize the Eclat algorithm for association rule mining.

## How to Use

You can navigate into each subfolder (apriori and eclat) to find the respective code implementations and follow the provided README.md files within those folders for usage instructions.
