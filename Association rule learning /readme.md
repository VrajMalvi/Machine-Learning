# Association Rule Learning

This GitHub repository contains implementations of two popular association rule mining algorithms: Apriori and Eclat. These algorithms are commonly used in data mining and machine learning to discover interesting associations and patterns in transactional data.

## Apriori Algorithm

The "apriori" folder within this repository contains the Python implementation of the Apriori algorithm. Apriori is known for its breadth-first approach to finding frequent itemsets and association rules. The code here demonstrates how to preprocess data, train the Apriori model, and visualize the results.

## Eclat Algorithm

The "eclat" folder within this repository contains the Python implementation of the Eclat algorithm. Eclat, in contrast to Apriori, uses a depth-first approach and focuses on intersecting transaction lists to discover frequent itemsets. The code provided showcases data preprocessing, model training, and result visualization using Eclat.

## Code Overview

Each algorithm folder contains a README file with detailed explanations of the code, its purpose, and how to use it. You'll find step-by-step instructions and examples for running Apriori and Eclat on your transactional datasets.

## Prerequisites

To run these algorithms, make sure you have Python installed, along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:


## How to Use

Please refer to the respective README files in the "apriori" and "eclat" folders for usage instructions, code explanations, and examples.

## Contributions

If you have any improvements, bug fixes, or additional features to suggest for the Apriori or Eclat implementations, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are welcome and encouraged!
