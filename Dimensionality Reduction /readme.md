# Wine Group Prediction using PCA, LDA, and Kernel PCA

## Uncorking Insights: Predicting Wine Preferences with Dimensionality Reduction 🍷

Welcome to the world of wine, where every sip reveals a story! 🍇 In this project, we embark on a delightful journey to predict the wine group/category using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Kernel PCA. Our aim? To serve the perfect glass to every wine enthusiast.

## The Wine Odyssey 🌍

We are the custodians of a unique dataset containing wines from three distinct groups/categories. Each group represents a community of wine connoisseurs, bonded by their shared preferences. With the power of dimensionality reduction, we seek to predict which group a new wine belongs to. Why? So we can recommend the finest vintages to the most discerning customers. 🥂

## The "Grapes of Data" 📊

**Dataset**: Behold the "Wine.csv," a treasure chest of wine data.

## Code Tour 🚀

Let's unravel our adventure step by step:

### Data Magic 🪄

1. **Importing the Essentials**: We assemble our magical toolkit, including numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and more.

2. **Dataset Discovery**: We uncork the dataset to reveal its secrets.

3. **Train or Test**: The dataset splits into the training and test sets, ensuring a perfect blend.

4. **Scaling the Experience**: We standardize our input data, the key to a harmonious wine prediction.

### The Dimensionality Reduction Alchemy 🌟

5. **PCA: The Wizard of Dimensions**: Enter Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By setting `n_components` to 2, we shrink our data to a mesmerizing two-dimensional view. This view is the artist's canvas for visualization and insight. 🎨

6. **LDA: Unveiling the Discriminant Power**: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) further enhances our predictions. 🚀

7. **Kernel PCA: A Flavorful Approach**: Kernel PCA spices up our analysis, providing a unique perspective. 🌶️

### Enchanting the Model 🧙‍♂️

8. **The Predictive Brew**: We train a Logistic Regression model with our secret recipe on the training set.

### The Crystal Ball 🔮

9. **Predictions and Confusion**: We look into the crystal ball, making predictions and creating a beautiful confusion matrix. 

10. **Accuracy Elixir**: We measure the model's magical accuracy.

### Visualizing the Magic 🪄

11. **Training Set Fantasia**: We weave visual spells on the training set results.

12. **Test Set Sorcery**: We extend our visual enchantments to the test set results.

## The Enchanted Results ✨

Our PCA, LDA, and Kernel PCA-powered Logistic Regression model uncorks insights and accurately predicts wine group/category. The visualization reveals the mesmerizing separation of wine groups based on the selected dimensionality reduction techniques.
