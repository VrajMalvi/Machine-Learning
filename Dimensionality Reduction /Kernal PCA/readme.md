# Types of Kernels in Kernel PCA (Python)

Kernel Principal Component Analysis (Kernel PCA) is a technique that uses different types of kernels to map data into a higher-dimensional space, where it might become more linearly separable. These kernels introduce non-linearity and help transform data for better principal component analysis.

1. **Linear Kernel (`linear`):** This kernel performs standard PCA. It doesn't introduce non-linearity into the transformation.

2. **Polynomial Kernel (`poly`):** The polynomial kernel introduces non-linearity. You can specify the degree of the polynomial using the `degree` parameter.

3. **Radial Basis Function Kernel (`rbf` or `gaussian`):** The Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel is a popular choice when data is not linearly separable.

4. **Sigmoid Kernel (`sigmoid`):** The sigmoid kernel introduces non-linearity using a hyperbolic tangent transformation. You can specify the `coef0` and `gamma` parameters.

5. **Custom Kernel:** You can define your custom kernel by passing a callable function. This offers flexibility to design a kernel tailored to your specific problem.

Each kernel type has its characteristics and can be useful depending on the nature of your data and problem. Experimenting with different kernels and their hyperparameters is often necessary to find the most effective one for your specific problem.

Experiment with these kernels to optimize Kernel PCA for your data analysis and machine learning tasks.
